# WA

WA is Rio window assistant.

WA is a fork from Winit intended to serve solely Rio terminal with addition of features and functionalities like open urls.

Considering that WA is built for Rio only, is highly recommend don't use this crate for personal usage. For personal usage it's recommended use either [Winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/) or [Tao](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao) (another fork of winit).

WA also have a ROADMAP to use SwiftUI.

Note: Eventually other platforms besides MacOS will be ported to WA.
