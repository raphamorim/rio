        It’s a tiny one but this release features my first ever contribution to
        an open source project and it feels so nice to give back to this amazing
        project that has become my main terminal.

        It is a privilege to be invited to beta test Rio! It has brought me closer to the code of the project, and I have learned a lot about how to develop a terminal emulator.

        Rapha is not only one of the most talented programmers I've ever met but also one of the best friends I've had in my life. It’s no surprise to me that Rio embodies such exceptional quality and speed. As a terminal emulator, Rio has set a new standard—it’s unquestionably the go-to solution.
