        Rio has become my standard terminal emulator for some time and it works well in professional use. Raphael is doing a great work and is awesome at listening to feedback to the community for new and improved features.

        It‚Äôs a tiny one but this release features my first ever contribution to
        an open source project and it feels so nice to give back to this amazing
        project that has become my main terminal.

        Installed Rio recently and am impressed how smooth and fast this terminal is. Already set up as my default go-to terminal! Looking forward to the continued development and what is to come. Keep up the awesome job Raphael!

        It is a privilege to be invited to beta test Rio! It has brought me closer to the code of the project, and I have learned a lot about how to develop a terminal emulator.
