**Note: iTerm Image Protocol is still under development**

Rio implements support for the iTerm2 inline image protocol.

To render an image inline in your terminal, you can use `imgcat` provided as a script by iTerm2 in [iterm2.com/utilities/imgcat](https://iterm2.com/utilities/imgcat) or from other sources like:

- [pypi.org/project/imgcat](https://pypi.org/project/imgcat/)
- [npmjs.com/package/term-img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/term-img)
- [npmjs.com/package/imgcat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imgcat)
- ... and etecetera.

```bash
imgcat ./rio-logo.png
```
