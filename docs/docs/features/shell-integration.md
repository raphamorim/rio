Rio supports integrating with the shell through the following means:

- OSC 7 Escape sequences to advise the terminal of the working directory.
- OSC 133 Escape sequence to define Input, Output and Prompt zones.
- OSC 1337 Escape sequences to set user vars for tracking additional shell state.

OSC is escape sequence jargon for Operating System Command.
