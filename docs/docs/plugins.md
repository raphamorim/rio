Rio can support any plugin written in WASM or Lua directly.

Plugins works in Rio based on events. Let's say you would like to create an [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) or any AI plugin that would integrate with Rio terminal.

In the plugin you can specify how it would work, let's write one in Rust:

```rs


```

- `onmousemove()`
- `onmouseclick()`
- `onmouserelease()`
- `onkeyup()`
- `onkeydown()`
- `onrender()`
- `requestrender()`
- `appendelement()`
