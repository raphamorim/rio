Configure fonts used by the terminal.

Note: You can set different font families but Rio terminal
will always look for regular font bounds whene

You can also set family on root to overwrite all fonts.

```toml
[fonts]
family = "cascadiacode"
```

## Extra fonts

You can also specify extra fonts to load:

```toml
[fonts]
extras = [{ family = "Microsoft JhengHei" }]
```

## Font features

In case you want to specify any font feature:

```toml
[fonts]
features = ["ss02", "ss03", "ss05", "ss19"]
```

Note: Font features do not have support to live reload on configuration, so to reflect your changes, you will need to close and reopen Rio.

## Default configuration

The font configuration default:

```toml
[fonts]
size = 18
features = []

[fonts.regular]
family = "cascadiacode"
style = "normal"
weight = 400

[fonts.bold]
family = "cascadiacode"
style = "normal"
weight = 800

[fonts.italic]
family = "cascadiacode"
style = "italic"
weight = 400

[fonts.bold-italic]
family = "cascadiacode"
style = "italic"
weight = 800
```

## Emojis

You can also specify which emoji font you would like to use, by default will be loaded a built-in Twemoji color by Mozilla.

In case you would like to change:

```toml
# Apple
# [fonts.emoji]
# family = "Apple Color Emoji"

# In case you have Noto Color Emoji installed
# [fonts.emoji]
# family = "Noto Color Emoji"
```

## Hinting

Enable or disable font hinting. It is enabled by default.

```toml
[fonts]
hinting = true
```

## User interface

You can specify user interface font on Rio.

Note: `fonts.ui` does not have live reload configuration update, you need to close and open Rio again.

```toml
[fonts.ui]
family = "Departure Mono"
```
