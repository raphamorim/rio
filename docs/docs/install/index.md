Rio terminal applications have two type of builds: stable and canary.

While stable versions are thoroughly tested and takes longer to release, canary versions are created by daily and weekly basis.

To check if you are using a stable or canary version, you can check the version: stable follows the semantic versioning so you would often see stable releases similar to `v0.0.0` pattern, while canary appends the "-canary" suffix to the version (eg. `v0.0.0-canary`).
