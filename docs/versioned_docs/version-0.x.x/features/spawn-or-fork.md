In POSIX-based systems, Rio spawn processes instead of forking due to some compatibility issues between platforms.

However you can also switch from spawn to fork, forking a process is faster than spawning a process.

See how to configure it in the advanced section [here](/docs/0.x.x/configuration-file).
