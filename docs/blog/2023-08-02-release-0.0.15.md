This post also includes changes from v0.0.13 and v0.0.12.

# Highlights

- Navigation.
- Custom key bindings.
- Performance updates.
- Color automation for tabs.

## Navigation

Rio allows to choose navigation between the following options:

- <span class="keyword">CollapsedTab</span>
- <span class="keyword">BottomTab</span>
- <span class="keyword">TopTab</span>
- <span class="keyword">Breadcrumb</span>

You can set the navigation mode in the configuration file. An example of configuration:

```toml
[navigation]
mode = "BottomTab"
use-current-path = true
clickable = false
```

Note: BottomTab and TopTab does not support click mode yet.

Below some images with different navigation setups:

- First image: BottomTab navigation x11.
- Second image: TopTav navigation wayland.

- First image: Breadcrumb navigation macos.
- Second image: BottomTab navigation macos.

## Sugarloaf performance improvements

Performance improvements with Sugarloaf de-duplication of input data.

Before an average sugarloaf.stack call would cost around "~253.5Âµs" and now it does cost an average of "~51.5Âµs".

The algorithm is effective whenever the terminal has a lot of repetition like empty spaces. The benchmark test below was made rendering 100.000 characters that had repetition:

![second example navigation Wayland](../static/assets/posts/0.0.15/de-duplication-sugarloaf.jpg)

The de-duplication algorithm in the renderer considerably reduced the initial rendering time from avg <span class="keyword">6ms to 2ms</span> and using Rio in a large screen (>=136 columns) has dropped from <span class="keyword">36ms to 8ms</span>.

## Color automation for navigation

Rio allows to specify color overwrites for tabs based on program context.

The example below sets <span class="keyword">#FFFF00</span> as color background whenever <span class="keyword">nvim</span> is running.

![example navigation with color automation](../static/assets/features/demo-colorized-navigation.png)
![second example navigation with color automation](../static/assets/features/demo-colorized-navigation-2.png)

The configuration would be like:

```toml
[navigation]
color-automation = [
  { program = "nvim", color = "#FFFF00" }
]
```

## Custom key bindings

Now you can configure custom key bindings for Rio terminal.

Below an example of two custom key bindings:

```toml
[bindings]
keys = [
  { key = "q", with = "super", action = "Quit" }
  # Bytes[27, 91, 53, 126] is equivalent to "\x1b[5~"
  { key = "home", with = "super | shift", bytes = [27, 91, 53, 126] }
]
```

For example, in the first binding will tell Rio to close the terminal every time that "q" key is pressed along with "super" (in MacOS the "super" key is "command").

More info about custom key bindings in [docs/key-bindings](/rio/docs/documentation/key-bindings/).
