# Overview

Rio release 0.0.7 is finally here, there's a lot of updates to cover so let's get started. I also would like to remind you that Rio is still unstable. This release adds a lot of bug fixes and feature additions in order to make Rio terminal stable.

## Breaking change: Styles properties have been moved to root level

The only breaking change of v0.0.7 is that styles properties such as "font", "theme" and "font-size" moved to the root level.

Before:

```toml
cursor = '|'
[style]
font-size = 18
theme = "lucario"
{% endhighlight %}

After:

```toml
cursor = '|'
theme = "lucario"
font-size = 18
```


## Reload automatically when the configuration file has changed.

Any file update in the configuration file will trigger a render operation in Rio terminal with the new configuration.

If you have any suggestion of configuration ideas to Rio, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/new).


## width and height is not longer available in the configuration file.

The property witdh and height doesn't work anymore after the 0.0.7 release.

Before you could set the initial width and height of the screen, this configuration is not longer possible. It was removed due to compatibility with different targets.

## Stabilization of Linux x11 and Wayland

In older versions of Rio terminal it was possible to actually use Rio but it was slow and buggy for many users. Many fixes has been done in the v0.0.7 to bring the experience of Linux users close to what MacOS have right now.

The tweet below have a video demo that shows Rio running with X11:

## Custom font rendering

Now you can actually use different installed fonts by changing the property "font".

The example below considers that you have "Fira code" font installed in your machine.

```toml
font = "Fira code"
```

A quick look of how font updates looks like in v0.0.7:

## Sugarloaf ported to WebAssembly

The Rio support to WASM has moved one step ahead by introduction of Sugarloaf (Rio renderer) to WebAssembly.
