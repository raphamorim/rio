/*!
Script aware cluster segmentation.

This module provides support for breaking text into clusters that are
appropriate for shaping with a given script. For most scripts, clusters are
equivalent to Unicode grapheme clusters. More complex scripts, however,
may produce shaping clusters that contain multiple graphemes.
