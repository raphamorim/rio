## About

Documentation: https://raphamorim.io/rio

If you are using or want to help in any way please consider to donate via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/raphamorim).

Rio would not be possible without [few acknowledgements](#acknowledgments) and specially [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/), since a lot of Rio functionalities (e.g: ANSI parser, events, grid system) was originally written (and still uses a good amount) of Alacritty code.

## Supporting the Project

If you use and like Rio, please consider sponsoring it: your support helps to cover the fees required to maintain the project and to validate the time spent working on it!
