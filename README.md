> **⚠️ Development Notice**: We are currently in the process of releasing Rio 0.3.0, which includes major performance improvements and architectural changes. The main branch is under active development and may be unstable. For stable usage, please use [v0.2.20 or below](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/releases).

## About

Documentation: https://rioterm.com

If you are using or want to help in any way please consider to donate via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/raphamorim).

Rio would not be possible without [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/), since a lot of Rio functionalities (e.g: ANSI parser, events, processor) was originally written (and still uses a good amount) of Alacritty code.

## Supporting the Project

If you use and like Rio, please consider sponsoring it: your support helps to cover the fees required to maintain the project and to validate the time spent working on it!
