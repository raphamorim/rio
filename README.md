# Rio terminal

> tl;dr: Rio is a terminal built to run everywhere, as a native desktop applications by Rust or even in the browser powered by WebAssembly.

> [!NOTE]
> The `v0.1.x` releases are yet unstable compared to `v0.0.x`. If any new release from `v0.1.x` doesn't work for you, it is highly recommended to keep with `v0.0.x` versions until the issue is fixed.

Rio would not be possible without [few acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) and specially [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/), since a lot of Rio functionalities (e.g: ANSI parser, events, grid system) was originally written (and still uses a good amount) of Alacritty code.
