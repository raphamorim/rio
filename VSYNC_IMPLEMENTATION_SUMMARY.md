# Rio VSync Implementation - Zed-Style Efficiency

## What We Implemented

### 1. **Dirty Flag System**
- Added `needs_redraw: Cell<bool>` to window delegate state
- `request_redraw()` now sets dirty flag instead of immediately queuing redraw
- Only renders when something actually changed

### 2. **VSync-Synchronized Rendering**
- CVDisplayLink provides perfect timing with display refresh rate
- GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) for thread-safe communication
- Direct view pointer access (like Zed) for efficient state checking

### 3. **Conditional Rendering Flow**
```rust
// Old flow (always renders on VSync):
CVDisplayLink → GCD → queue_redraw() → RedrawRequested → render

// New flow (only renders when needed):
CVDisplayLink → GCD → check dirty flag → if dirty: queue_redraw() → RedrawRequested → render
                                      → if clean: skip (no unnecessary work)
```

### 4. **Key Benefits**
- **Power Efficient**: No unnecessary redraws when content is static
- **Perfect VSync**: Hardware-synchronized timing eliminates tearing
- **Multi-Display Support**: Adapts to different refresh rates automatically
- **Event Queue Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary event processing

## Architecture Comparison

### **Zed's Approach (Now Rio's Approach)**
```rust
// Only render when something changed
if invalidator.is_dirty() {
    window.draw(cx);
    window.present();
    invalidator.set_clean();
}
```

### **Previous Rio Approach**
```rust
// Always queue redraw on VSync
queue_redraw(); // Even when nothing changed
```

## Implementation Details

### **CVDisplayLink Integration**
- Uses view pointer for direct access (no locks/searches)
- GCD dispatch source for main thread communication
- Proper lifecycle management (start/stop on visibility changes)

### **Window State Management**
- Dirty flag set by `request_redraw()`
- Cleared by VSync callback before triggering actual redraw
- Thread-safe access through Cell<bool>

### **Multi-Display Support**
- Display link recreated when window moves between displays
- Automatic adaptation to different refresh rates (60Hz, 120Hz, ProMotion)

## Testing

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Static Content**: When nothing changes, should see minimal/no redraw events
2. **Dynamic Content**: When content changes, should see smooth 60fps/120fps rendering
3. **Multi-Display**: Moving window between displays should maintain smooth rendering

## Performance Impact

- **Idle State**: Near-zero CPU usage (no unnecessary redraws)
- **Active State**: Perfect VSync timing with minimal overhead
- **Event Queue**: Reduced traffic when content is static
- **Power Usage**: Significant reduction during idle periods

This implementation brings Rio's rendering efficiency in line with Zed's proven approach while maintaining Rio's existing event-driven architecture.
