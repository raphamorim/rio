# Arrival to Linux, Themes support and many bug fixes.

Rio release 0.0.5 is finally here, there's a lot of updates to cover so let's get started. I also would like to remind you that Rio is still unstable. This release adds a lot of bug fixes and feature additions in order to make Rio terminal stable.

## New configuration path

Configuration path has changed from "{$HOME}/.rio/" to "{$HOME}/.config/rio".

Changes were applied for macOS and Linux.

## Linux Support

Rio is now available to Linux, build information was added in the [install](/rio/install) page.

Linux builds are considered less stable than macOs, due to macOs features availability comparison.

## Themes Support

A new property was added to Rio configuration file called "theme". You can set the theme that you want to use and Rio will look in the folder "themes" in the configuration path.
