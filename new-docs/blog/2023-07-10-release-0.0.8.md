## Homebrew as Cask

Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's operating system, macOS.

Rio has been added as a cask [formulae.brew.sh/cask/rio](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rio) to their package source. To install Rio with homebrew you need to run the command below:

{% highlight javascript %}
brew update && brew install --cask rio
{% endhighlight %}

Github reference: [github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/149824](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/149824)

## Homebrew as Formula

Rio has been added as a formula [formulae.brew.sh/formula/rio](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rio) to their package source. To install Rio with homebrew you need to run the command below:

## Selection improvements and increase/decrease font-size in a session 

The version v0.0.8 has added the following missing functionalities: Scroll and select, Semantic and line selection and the ability to increase, decrease and reset font size using keyboard shortcut during session coming for Rio terminal.

## Migration to Corcovado

Rio terminal migrated from Mio to Corcovado. Corcovado is a maintained fork of mio 0.6.x along mio-signal-hook, mio-extras and using Windows API that works in Windows 11. It uses Rust edition 2021 instead of 2018.

Corcovado also uses Rust standard library for net and io instead of Mio 0.6.x.
