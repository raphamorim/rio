## Underline and strikethrough style

Support to text styling as such "Underline" and "Strikethrough".

## Tabs support

Tabs has been added to Rio terminal for macos and linux platform.

The shortcuts:

- Create tab: Logo key (Command in macos) + T.
- Close tab: Logo key (Command in macos) + W.
- Switch tab: Control key + Tab key.

Below you can see an example of usage:
