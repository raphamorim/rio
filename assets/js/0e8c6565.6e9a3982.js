so let\'s get started. I also would like to remind you that Rio is still unstable. This release adds a lot of bug fixes and feature additions in order to make Rio terminal stable.\\n\\n## Multi window support\\n\\nRio terminal has added the support to multi window feature.\\n\\n<img src=\\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2914/format:webp/1*KyVD4EJ-wQU8pTmOFTwaQg.png\\" width=\\"100%\\" />\\n\\nShortcuts:\\n\\n- MacOS: Command + N\\n- Windows: Alt + N\\n- Linux: Control + N\\n\\n## Support to older MacOS versions (older or equal to Big Sur).\\n\\nNow it is available for versions below Ventura (Rome).\\n\\n## Choose between fork or spawn\\n\\nDecide which one to use in the configuration file by the usage of propery \\"use-fork\\":\\n\\n```toml\\nuse-fork = false\\n```\\n\\nDefaults for POSIX-based systems:\\n\\n- MacOS: spawn processes\\n- Linux/BSD: fork processes\\n\\n## Inverse instructions\\n\\nBefore the v0.0.9, programs were not correctly rendered in the terminal due to the lack of inverse instruction in Rio.\\n\\nFor example, ranger uses inverse to show the active path.\\n\\nBefore:\\n\\n![Rio before 0.0.9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3630346/245280487-12af56a1-d9ad-4310-bd4e-3d96d42e8a42.png)\\n\\nNow:\\n\\n![Rio now](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3630346/251224085-39531c88-8e04-48ad-b09a-8fd12a0e011b.png)\\n\\n## Introduced \\"rio\\" terminfo\\n\\nTerminfo (formerly Termcap) is a database of terminal capabilities and more. For every (well almost) model of terminal it tells application programs what the terminal is capable of doing.\\n\\nIt tells what escape sequences (or control characters) to send to the terminal in order to do things such as move the cursor to a new location, erase part of the screen, scroll the screen, change modes, change appearance (colors, brightness, blinking, underlining, reverse video etc.).\\n\\nAfter about 1980, many terminals supported over a hundred different commands (some of which take numeric parameters).\\n\\nRio terminal has now it\'s own terminfo:\\n\\n```sh\\n$ echo $TERM\\nrio\\n```\\n\\nMore info [here](/docs/install#terminfo).\\n\\n## Fixes for multi-byte rendering\\n\\nBefore the v0.0.9, multi-byte characters were not correctly rendered in the terminal.\\n\\nBefore: As reported in the issue [#127](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/127)\\n\\nNow:\\n\\n![Now](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3630346/252940293-da345089-3d4c-4d05-8b0f-d0665f1e1347.png)\\n\\n## Configuration file addition: shell\\n\\nNow you can set \\"shell.program\\" to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. \\"/bin/fish\\".\\n\\nEntries in \\"shell.args\\" are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.\\n\\n```toml\\nshell = { program = \\"/bin/zsh\\", args = [\\"--login\\"] }\\n```\\n\\nDefaults:\\n\\n- MacOS: /bin/zsh --login\\n- Linux/BSD: user login shell\\n- Windows: powershell\\n\\n## Configuration file addition: working_dir\\n\\nDirectory the shell is started in. If this is unset the working\\ndirectory of the parent process will be used.\\n\\nThis configuration only has effect if use-fork is disabled\\n\\n```toml\\nworking_dir = \\"/Users/raphael/Documents/\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Configuration file removal: Advanced\\n\\nBreaking changes for configuration file regarding \\"Advanced\\". The configuration \\"Advanced\\" has moved to root level and \\"disable-render-when-unfocused\\" renamed to \\"disable-unfocused-render\\".\\n\\n```toml\\ntheme = \\"dracula\\"\\n\\n[advanced]\\ndisable-render-when-unfocused = true\\n```\\n\\n**now**\\n\\n```toml\\ntheme = \\"dracula\\"\\ndisable-unfocused-render = true\\n```\\n\\n## Changelog of v0.0.9\\n\\n- The configuration \\"Advanced\\" has moved to root level and \\"disable-render-when-unfocused\\" renamed to \\"disable-unfocused-render\\".\\n- Support to **spawn and fork processes**, spawn has became default. Spawn increases Rio compability in a broad range, like old MacOS versions (older or equal to Big Sur). However, If you want to use Rio terminal to fork processes instead of spawning processes, enable \\"use-fork\\" in the configuration file.\\n- Introduced \\"RIO_LOG_LEVEL\\" variable usage.\\n- Increased max tabs from 6 to 9.\\n- Fix Incorrect cursor position when using multi-byte characters (Ref: [#127](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/127))\\n- Fix bug [\\"black screen with nearly zero interactivity\\"](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/112) and new tab hanging.\\n- Fix cursor disappearing after resize.\\n- Introduction of \\"shell\\" and \\"working_dir\\" in configuration file.\\n- Multi window support [#97](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/97).\\n- Corrections on select and scroll experience (it was using wrongly font-bound for line calculation).\\n- Add selection color to the theme config (closed [#125](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/125)).\\n- Implemented Inverse (fix [#92](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/92)).\\n- Proper choose formats that matches Rio requirements (related [#122](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/122)).\\n- Corcovado: Filter windows crate dependency to only Windows targets (related: [#119](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/119)).\\n- Teletypewriter: Fixes for musl as target_env (related: [#119](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/119)).\\n- FreeBSD support, implementation by [yurivict](https://github.com/yurivict) ([Commit](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/8582b8c59459a7dc5112a94a39de45f6cc124c3e), Ref: [#115](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/issues/115))"},{"id":"/2023/07/07/release-0.0.7","metadata":{"permalink":"/rio/blog/2023/07/07/release-0.0.7","editUrl":"https://github.com/raphamorim/rio/tree/main/docs/blog/2023-07-07-release-0.0.7.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-07-release-0.0.7.mdx","title":"Rio 0.0.7","description":"Configuration reload, x11 and wayland stabilization, sugarloaf ported to WebAssembly, addition to NIX OS packages and other updates.","date":"2023-07-07T12:34:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 7, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":2.86,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Rio 0.0.7","date":"2023-07-07 12:34","description":"Configuration reload, x11 and wayland stabilization, sugarloaf ported to WebAssembly, addition to NIX OS packages and other updates.","categories":"release macos linux webassembly"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Rio 0.0.9","permalink":"/rio/blog/2023/07/17/release-0.0.9"},"nextItem":{"title":"Rio 0.0.8","permalink":"/rio/blog/2023/07/10/release-0.0.8"}},"content":"import { Tweet } from \'react-tweet\';\\n\\n## v0.0.7: Highlights\\n\\n- Support to custom fonts\\n- Configuration reload\\n- x11 and wayland stabilization\\n- Sugarloaf ported to WebAssembly\\n- Addition to NIX OS packages (kudos to [@otavio](https://github.com/otavio), PR: [NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/237664](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/237664))\\n- Styles properties have been moved to root level\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nRio release 0.0.7 is finally here, there\'s a lot of updates to cover so let\'s get started.
